# üíª HNG 13 ‚Äî Frontend Track Tasks

Welcome to my repository for all **HNG 13 Frontend Bootcamp** tasks! üéØ
This repo contains my solutions, projects, and experiments as I progress through each **stage of the HNG Internship (Cohort 13)**.

Each task is organized into its own folder with a dedicated README, source files, and (where applicable) a live hosted version.

---

## Overview

The **HNG Internship** is a fast-paced, real-world software development program designed to help developers learn, build, and grow by completing progressively challenging tasks.

This repo showcases my progress through the **Frontend Track**, focused on:

- Semantic and accessible HTML
- Modern, responsive CSS (Flexbox, Grid, etc.)
- JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation
- API integration, component design, and testing
- Version control and deployment best practices
